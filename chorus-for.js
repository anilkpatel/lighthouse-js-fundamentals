// MODULE 4: INTRO TO PROGRAMMING: 
// FOR LOOPS

// Commong structure for looping in JS
// The idea of a for loop is very similar to a while, only all the code that relates to the state of the loop is written on one line. 

//Anatomy of a for loop:
//Syntaxâ€”a for loop requires 3 statements (separated by semicolons):
// 1) Initializing the loop (to declare our counter variable
// 2) Defining our while condition
// 3) Updating the state of our loop after every step.

// Write a FOR LOOP
/*
//Exercise 1: New chorus program

const chorus = "Let's dance!";
for (let repeat = 0; repeat < 10; repeat ++) {
  console.log(chorus);
}
console.log("Until the sun comes up!");
*/
//Same as the While Loop
//our counter variable, repeat, our condition that should be true for our loop to continue, and the incrementing of our counter variable, are all written in one line.
